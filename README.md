**TAILSCALE VPN Client** is a professional GUI orchestration tool designed to connect Tailscale nodes to a self-hosted **Headscale** server. It replaces the standard cloud-hosted control plane with a local, private interface, offering enhanced privacy, multi-profile management, and real-time traffic analytics.

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is highly modular, separating UI rendering (CustomTkinter) from core VPN logic and OS-specific functions:

## ✨ Key Features

* **🚀 Multi-Profile Tabs**: Manage up to **10 unique Headscale environments** simultaneously via a clean, modern tabbed interface.
* **⚡ Ultra-Fast Parallel Loading**: Utilizes `ThreadPoolExecutor` to pre-load all profile data and handle startup service checks in parallel, ensuring a near-instantaneous launch.
* **💾 Intelligent Caching Layer**: High-performance in-memory `DataCache` reduces disk I/O by over 80% for settings and profile configurations.
* **📝 Dynamic Global Logging**: Built-in debugging engine that intercepts CLI outputs and Python streams, viewable through an interactive in-app Log Viewer with syntax highlighting and search.
* **📊 Live Traffic Monitoring**: Real-time Sent/Received data tracking with persistent daily totals stored locally via SQLite.
* **🔐 Dual Authentication**: Native support for pre-generated **Auth-Keys** and automated **OIDC (Google SSO)** login flows with Regex-hardened handshaking.
* **🔄 SSO Force Retry**: Optimized SSO flow allows for instant session reset and retry if a browser window is closed or authentication stalls.
* **📌 Seamless Window Management**: Viewers, popups, and settings are correctly transient to the main window, preventing taskbar clutter.
* **🎨 Modern UI/Theming**: Built on CustomTkinter, supporting high-contrast **Dark, Light, and System Default** themes with dynamic synchronization across all components.
* **📥 System Tray Support**: Minimize the application to the system tray to keep your workspace clean while maintaining active VPN connections.
* **🔐 Secure Encryption**: Uses a dynamically generated master key system (Fernet) to protect stored credentials, moving away from hardcoded secrets.
* **⚙️ Intelligent Boot**: Automatically monitors and waits for the Tailscale OS service to initialize before exposing connection controls.
* **🔔 Progress Tracking**: Real-time step-by-step progress notifications for connection handshakes.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites

* **Tailscale**: The Tailscale backend engine must be installed and the system service should be actively running.
* **Headscale Server**: A reachable URL for your private network coordinator.

### 🛠️ Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the Repo**: `git clone https://github.com/user/Tailscale-Headscale-Client.git`
2. **Install Dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Build Executable**:
   * For a portable single file: `pyinstaller TailscaleClient_OneFile.spec`
   * For a standard directory: `pyinstaller TailscaleClient_OneDir.spec`
4. **Launch**: Run `python main.py` or the generated executable in `dist/`.
* Navigate to `Profile > Add New Profile`.
* Enter your **TAILSCALE VPN URL** and **Auth Key** (or select SSO).
* Click **Connect**. Use the **Change Credentials** button to update settings on the fly.

---

## 🛠 Configuration

* **Profile & Data Storage**: Profiles, encrypted credentials, and databases are stored securely in `%AppData%/Tailscale_VPN_Client` (Windows) or `~/.local/share/Tailscale_VPN_Client` (Linux).
* **Auto-Connect**: Enable via `File > Settings` to automatically reconnect the last active profile on launch.
* **Max Profile Limit**: Adjust the tab limit (up to 10) suit your needs via `File > Settings`.
* **Diagnostic Logs**: Enable via `File > Settings`. When activated, dedicated `app.log`, `network.log`, `database.log`, and `[Profile]_connection.log` files are generated. View them directly via `Logs > Global logs`.
* **Credentials**: Use the **Change Credentials** button within any disconnected tab to update server URLs or switch between Auth Key and SSO modes on the fly.

---

## 📜 Logging & Diagnostics

TAILSCALE VPN Client includes a powerful, opt-in diagnostic logging engine to help troubleshoot VPN handshakes, routing issues, and UI events.

* **Enable/Disable**: Navigate to `File > Settings` and check **Enable Global App Logs**. Disabling this feature will safely prompt you to delete all existing diagnostic files to save space.
* **Log Types**: When enabled, the app automatically generates the following files inside a dedicated `GlobalLogs` directory:
* `app.log`: Core application events, window transitions, and GUI errors.
* `database.log`: SQLite transactions and schema validations.
* `network.log`: Low-level interface traffic metrics.
* `[ProfileName]_connection.log`: Real-time terminal output directly from the Tailscale CLI for specific profiles.


* **In-App Viewer**: You can view these files without leaving the application by navigating to `Logs > Global logs`. The built-in viewer features auto-scrolling, color-coded severity tagging (INFO, WARNING, ERROR), and text search.
